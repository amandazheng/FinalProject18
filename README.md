# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018
MagneTris is a one player game based on (but opposite to) the well-known game of Tetris. In Tetris, the player tries to prevent their stack of blocks from reaching the top of the screen by manipulating the orientation and location of the falling blocks. This is converse to MagneTris, where the objective is to stack the falling magnets to reach the top of the screen before time runs out. In addition, in MagneTris, the orientation and locations of the falling magnets are predetermined; however, the player has the ability to move a player magnet in order to “catch” the falling magnets to stack them. MagneTris also has some features that are completely unique to the game. For example, the magnets caught must be of opposing charges in order for them to connect, just as magnets work in real life. If a player accidentally catches a magnet of the same charge, their stack will lose one magnet. Along with this, if a falling magnet bumps into the side of a player’s stack of magnets, it will knock down all magnets above that point, resulting in the loss of one or more magnets.
